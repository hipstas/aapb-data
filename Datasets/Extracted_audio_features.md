## Extracted Audio Features

Click [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kse8hndzim7e49v/Extracted_audio_features.zip?dl=1) to download a set of pre-extracted audio features for 483 recordings in our corpus (1.72GB compressed). Each CSV file corresponds to a single file, and each row represents 0.5 seconds of audio.

We used the Python package pyAudioAnalysis for feature extraction. You can find more details and a key to each column [here](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis/wiki/3.-Feature-Extraction).
