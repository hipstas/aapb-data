In the interview Carter conducted for War and Peace in the Nuclear Age, he relates his experience as president-elect, when the task at hand was to absorb military force structure and preparedness. As Carter recalls, the Soviets temporarily shelved the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT) II talks after he pressed them on human-rights violations. From the get-go, he wanted an arms-control agreement that he negotiated, as opposed to one shaped by a prior administration. Rather than build from the 1974 Vladivostok agreement, Carter immediately sought dramatic reductions in nuclear weapons, but he was compelled to acquiesce to the step-by-step process that the Soviet Union would accept. The Salt II Treaty that he and Leonid Brezhnev signed in June 1979 was, Carter believed, the best they could do at the time. Not expecting the pitfalls that lay ahead, both men anticipated a SALT III agreement that would produce more-dramatic results. He recalls the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and its impact on the ratification of the SALT II agreement. In his interview, Carter also discusses his support for limited linkage, such as pressuring the Soviets to minimize their role in Ethiopia while still continuing arms talks. In 1978, there was general agreement about normalizing relations with China, to be followed by Deng Xiaoping's visit to the United States. The timing of the visit?it occurred just a month prior to a Soviet summit meeting?proved controversial, but it remains a decision that Carter defends. He also upholds his decision to approve funding for the MX missile as a stabilizing factor. Finally, Carter points out that the terms of SALT II, although never ratified, remained intact for at least seven years, and that its concepts provided a stable framework for subsequent negotiations.",Global Affairs,,Digital,,

Each makes a brief opening statement (Gingrich talks over some heckling) before answering audience questions on lobbying reform, medicare reform, ending partisan sniping in Washington, U.N. peacekeeping, the minimum wage, and balancing the budget/lowering the deficit while also preserving federal public service programs such as AmeriCorps. Clinton and Gingrich reveal areas of common ground on lobbying reform and Medicare reform and disagree respectfully on other issues. Attendees express hope in post-event reaction interviews that the town hall will herald more bipartisan cooperation in Washington and Gingrich says he'd be open to holding more joint town halls.

The agreement was reached after images of police attacking protesting children with dogs and fire hoses shocked the nation and world, and more than 1,000 students were jailed. The documentary includes commentary from various unnamed persons in Birmingham, in addition to speeches by Dr. Ralph D. Abernathy and Rev.

Host John Slade\n    argues that their example helps to explain why local people should care\n    about what is going on in Africa and how it affects American lives. The film\n    Malcolm X: Struggle for Freedom by poet Lebert Bethune and John Taylor first\n    examines the Pan-African teachings of Malcolm X through selections from his\n    speeches and voiceover analysis. Malcolm talks about the need to understand\n    the African American struggle as one of human rights, moving beyond Civil\n    Rights into the realm of the international. This perspective allows\n    activists to link American inequality and disenfranchisement with similar\n    problems in Africa, Latin America, Europe, and elsewhere. A number of\n    speeches from the mid-1960s argued that reaching out to ?dark-skinned?\n    peoples against exploitation by imperialists will provide a source of\n    strength, improve self-image, and help identify real leadership within the\n    American movement. Segments also include Malcolm discussing the role of the\n    intellectual and the importance of women within the American struggle.\n    Bracketing the film is a speech by Stokely Carmichael, in which he stresses\n    the African identity of American blacks. He argues that a white-dominated\n    history has denied African Americans claims to their identity and heritage\n    of struggle. Africans introduced civilization to the world, and these\n    peoples have constantly resisted imperialism and exploitation in an attempt\n    to preserve this unique character. Framing his discussion within the theory\n    of scientific socialism, he argues that capitalism is the real threat to\n    African peoples, as it corrupts communal tradition by over-emphasizing the\n    importance of individual aggrandizement. Citing problems with drugs and\n    accommodation, Carmichael urges the audience to place the community above\n    money and individualism. He says that eventually capitalism will collapse,\n    and that African peoples must actively unite and coordinate their actions to\n    successfully build a new socialist power base in Africa that will take its\n    place. An interview with Owusu Sadaukai, chairman of the African Liberation\n    Support Committee, completes the episode. He discusses the success of the\n    first African Liberation Day held in May of 1972 and the challenges of\n    organizing a more local and immediate celebration in 1973. He relates the\n    campaigns for independence occurring in southern Africa to Vietnam, noting\n    the role of the United States in supporting anti-revolutionary causes in\n    both regions. He also points to the economic links between the United States\n    and the region, drawing connections between domestic unemployment and\n    exploitative labor practices in factories outsourced to the region.\n    According to Sadaukai, Neo-colonialism and imperialism are a common threat\n    to both African Americans and Africans.

Host John Slade\n    argues that their example helps to explain why local people should care\n    about what is going on in Africa and how it affects American lives. The film\n    Malcolm X: Struggle for Freedom by poet Lebert Bethune and John Taylor first\n    examines the Pan-African teachings of Malcolm X through selections from his\n    speeches and voiceover analysis. Malcolm talks about the need to understand\n    the African American struggle as one of human rights, moving beyond Civil\n    Rights into the realm of the international. This perspective allows\n    activists to link American inequality and disenfranchisement with similar\n    problems in Africa, Latin America, Europe, and elsewhere. A number of\n    speeches from the mid-1960s argued that reaching out to ?dark-skinned?\n    peoples against exploitation by imperialists will provide a source of\n    strength, improve self-image, and help identify real leadership within the\n    American movement.

He argues that a white-dominated\n    history has denied African Americans claims to their identity and heritage\n    of struggle. Africans introduced civilization to the world, and these\n    peoples have constantly resisted imperialism and exploitation in an attempt\n    to preserve this unique character. Framing his discussion within the theory\n    of scientific socialism, he argues that capitalism is the real threat to\n    African peoples, as it corrupts communal tradition by over-emphasizing the\n    importance of individual aggrandizement. Citing problems with drugs and\n    accommodation, Carmichael urges the audience to place the community above\n    money and individualism. He says that eventually capitalism will collapse,\n    and that African peoples must actively unite and coordinate their actions to\n    successfully build a new socialist power base in Africa that will take its\n    place. An interview with Owusu Sadaukai, chairman of the African Liberation\n    Support Committee, completes the episode. He discusses the success of the\n    first African Liberation Day held in May of 1972 and the challenges of\n    organizing a more local and immediate celebration in 1973.

In the interview Carter conducted for War and Peace in the Nuclear Age, he relates his experience as president-elect, when the task at hand was to absorb military force structure and preparedness. As Carter recalls, the Soviets temporarily shelved the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT) II talks after he pressed them on human-rights violations. From the get-go, he wanted an arms-control agreement that he negotiated, as opposed to one shaped by a prior administration. Rather than build from the 1974 Vladivostok agreement, Carter immediately sought dramatic reductions in nuclear weapons, but he was compelled to acquiesce to the step-by-step process that the Soviet Union would accept. The Salt II Treaty that he and Leonid Brezhnev signed in June 1979 was, Carter believed, the best they could do at the time. Not expecting the pitfalls that lay ahead, both men anticipated a SALT III agreement that would produce more-dramatic results. He recalls the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and its impact on the ratification of the SALT II agreement. In his interview, Carter also discusses his support for limited linkage, such as pressuring the Soviets to minimize their role in Ethiopia while still continuing arms talks. In 1978, there was general agreement about normalizing relations with China, to be followed by Deng Xiaoping's visit to the United States. The timing of the visit?it occurred just a month prior to a Soviet summit meeting?proved controversial, but it remains a decision that Carter defends. He also upholds his decision to approve funding for the MX missile as a stabilizing factor. Finally, Carter points out that the terms of SALT II, although never ratified, remained intact for at least seven years, and that its concepts provided a stable framework for subsequent negotiations.",Global Affairs,,Digital,,
